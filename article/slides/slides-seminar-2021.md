# Introduction

# Background

- Vyborg was part of the autonomous Grand duchy of Finland from 1812 to 1917
- The city had a large Orthodox minority, of which 90% were Russians
- Vyborg was a mid-level hub of commerce and migration in the central place system
- Vyborg connected Eastern Finland to St. Petersburg

# Research problem

- Original idea to determine change of segregation
- Problems with data quality
- Determining how much population actually changes necessary

# Sources

# Parish records

- Most not available
- Vyborg health council reports total population by denomination in yearly reports
- Only available 1905-

# Sources for migration

- Lutheran parish in St. Petersburg for lutherans
- Poll tax register and parish registers both unreliable due to migration

# Poll tax registers

- For taxation, also record for voting rights and property ownership
- Senate degree in 1878: from 1880 onward poll tax registers should have columns for non-lutherans
- Religion recorded until 1920s

# Problems with sources

- Poll tax register numbers for orthodox population are inconsistent
- Total numbers of orthodox fluctuate too wildly to be real
- Some households with Russian names are marked Orthodox in some years and not in other years

# Method

# Time series analysis

- statistical methods for working with time series data
- common problems:
* spectral analysis (finding repeating patterns)
* shift point analysis (finding a point when a chance happens)
* autoregression models (how much previous observations affect next observation)
* moving average methods
* combinations of the above, e.g. ARMA

# Fourier transform
